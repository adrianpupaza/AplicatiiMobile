# AplicatiiMobile

What is this repository for?
The repository is for a mobile application that will implement a shopping list. The application will hold different profiles for different users and access to a profile is based on authentication. An authenticated user can add, modify or delete shopping lists (or items to a specific shopping list). All the list are stored locally for offline support and can be synchronized with a remote location when online. Users may export a shopping list, in which case the list will be sent via email to the email provided. (maybe even share lists with other users via email).
